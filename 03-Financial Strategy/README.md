# Financial-strategy---Sigtech---Woman-in-Data-Residency-Program

This project shows the last part of the wook done during a residency program hosted by __[SigTech](https://www.sigtech.com/)__ and __[Women in Data](https://www.womenindata.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAys2MBhDOARIsAFf1D1dMLMnhxqZh9hVP4kjfkmyvM0qlNrV5FsgmccrcWOURofLc2ReBTHsaAkdAEALw_wcB)__ .

The main goal of the program was to use alternative data to build signals governing financial strategies. 

In my case, I collected stocktwits related to environmental issues. I then performed sentiment analysis and I used this result to build a Signal that would later govern a financial Strategy.

This work was based on the publication __[Investors' Climate Sentiment and Financial Markets](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caterina-Santi-4/publication/344344260_Investors'_Climate_Sentiment_and_Financial_Markets/links/602e4b90299bf1cc26d2b651/)__.

The data collection was performed using the project __[Investors' Climate Sentiment and Financial Markets](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caterina-Santi-4/publication/344344260_Investors'_Climate_Sentiment_and_Financial_Markets/links/602e4b90299bf1cc26d2b651/)__.
The Sentiment Analysis was carried out within the project __[Sentiment Analysis of StockTwits related to environmental opinions](https://github.com/marianabarturen/Sentiment-Analysis-of-StockTwits-related-to-environmental-opinions)__.

In this notebook, the financial strategy will be explained although no code is going to be shown due to Sigtech Privacy Rights.
