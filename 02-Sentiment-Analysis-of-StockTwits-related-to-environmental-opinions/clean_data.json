saudi arabian and brazilian oil is easier to get to than oil on u.s private land, plus they have cheaper labor and much less environmental red tape). \n \nthus, free american citizens invented fracking and whenever the supply of oil goes down enough to bring up the price, many fracking companies spin into action because they can make a profit.  therefore, even those of us old enough to remember the opec gas shortage in the 1970&#39;s no longer worry whenever they threaten to cut the oil supply today.    that&#39;s exactly how i see the tailing process and the rare earths market
